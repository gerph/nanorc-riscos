# Nano RC files for RISC OS files

This repository contains syntax configuration files for the Nano editor for files on RISC OS.

RISC OS uses filetypes, which on non-RISC OS systems, are stored in the filename as a suffix `,xxx`. These are recognised by the 
configurations here.

The following syntax configurations are supplied:

* `arm.nanorc`: ARM source files, such as those assembled by the objasm tool.
* `bbcbasic.nanorc`: Text BBC BASIC files, with or without line numbers.
* `c-file.nanorc`: C file; although not specific to RISC OS, the configuration matches C filenames.
* `cmhg.nanorc`: C Module Header Generator file format.
* `jfpatch.nanorc`: My JFPatch assembler file format.
* `obey.nanorc`: RISC OS command colouring for Obey, Command, TaskObey, Exec and Desktop files.
